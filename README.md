## Project Description
The Peptide Length Calculator is a Python-based tool designed to calculate the total length of a peptide chain given a sequence of amino acids. This tool takes into account the distances between the N-terminal of one amino acid to the peptide bond of the next, as well as the distance from the last peptide bond to the C-terminal.

## Features
- Calculate the total length from the N-terminal of the first amino acid to the C-terminal of the last in a sequence.
- Uses standard distance measures for peptide bonds and terminal connections.
- Simple command-line interface for easy use.

## Installation
This project does not require any external libraries to run the main script. It is written in Python 3.x. To set it up, follow these steps:

1. Ensure that Python 3.x is installed on your system. You can download it from [Python's official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/M15160058/peptidelengthcalculator.git
## Requirement
You need FASTA sequence to calculate the length of the extended peptide of a protein.
